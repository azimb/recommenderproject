#Recommender Project

The main goal of the system is to match people with projects. In a basic sense, a recommender system works by looking at the similarity between items. So if Project A is dealing with "java, recommender systems, web development" and Project B is dealing with "c++, e-commerce, front end design", and my interests are "java, web development, game development", it would make most sense to recommend Project A to me over Project B.
